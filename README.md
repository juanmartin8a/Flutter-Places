An app to find trips to make (like AirBnB but for whole trip accommodations).

  - ## Why
    The goal for this app was to improve my UI skills by testing more complicated UI features like animations.

## Platforms
- iOS
- Android

## Tech used
- **Frontend framework**: Flutter (hence the name of the app ;) )
- **Main database**: Firebase Firestore
- **Authentication**: Firebase Auth
- **File storage**: Firebase Storage
- **Cloud functions**: Firebase using Typescript
- **Notifications**: Firebase Cloud Messaging
- **Place location**: Google Maps

## Features
- ### Trips
  A trip includes information such as:
    - Place
    - Pictures
    - Number of days
    - Number of nights
    - Price
    - Location
      
  Users can create trips :D

- ### Feed
  There is a main feed where recommended trips for the user appear.

- ### Adding trips system
  A user can add existing trips to their profile to plan on going there!

- ### Chat system
  A user interested in a trip can chat with the user who posted the trip, in here the users can exchange messages and pictures that can be obtained from the in-app camera, or from the device's gallery.

- ### Profile
  Each user has a profile which includes information such as:
    - Profile picture
    - Name
    - Username
    - Trips (trips that the user is planning on going)
    - My trips (trips the user is making)
 
## Example Video :)
The app was tested using an Android emulator in an old and saturated computer so the performance was terrible :). I sped up the video 2x.
